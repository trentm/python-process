# High Priority

- The install fails if which.py is not installed. That sucks.
- add a changelog


# Medium Priority

- fix MANIFEST.in processing from picking up README.txt in .svn dirs
- get setup.py to be properly updated with project-info.xml changes
- add some docs to the dist
- What to do with Komodo change 126161 (None-ing 'cwd' if looks like UNC
  path)?
